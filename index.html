This change reflected on the housing pattern of this nation resulted in many people reconsidering where they would live. These transformations had a significant impact on the US housing markets, that homeowners and the potential buyers may postpone their plan on real estate trading, and influenced the developers’ strategy on new home buildings as the result. The domestic population movement also reflected the fear of densely populated metropolitan areas and showed a trend of new suburbanization. And the popularity of remote working also may influence people’s decision on housing.</h2></div>

Our data shows a strong correlation between population change and new home developments on a national level, that the population in major coastal metropolitan areas dropped significantly and separately migrated to inland or southern states such as Arizona, Utah, Texas and Florida. And the new home completion data shows the hot real estate development counties mostly located in or near these states. The surrounding metropolitan area grew faster than the core city, indicating that suburban and exurban growth outpaced urban growth. As a case study, we also analyzed the data from New York City. The population moving trends in the city were highly homogeneous generally in 2018 to 2022, but a significant migration volume appeared in 2020. The new housing development data shows less correlation with the population migration or the national level data that may prove the new real estate business in New York City has less influence from the pandemic. </h2>

In 2022, there was a drop in new housing units that began construction, after a higher-than-normal increase in 2021. It is interesting to note that housing unit construction didn’t see any overall decline until 2022, two years after the pandemic began.

Supply of single-family units peaked in 2005 and is at its lowest in 2011 since 1974. Single-family unit completion steadily recovered from 2011 to 2021 and declined slightly in 2022. While single-family units had a significant rise and drop between 2000-2011, multi-family unit completion remained steady. For multifamily units, the number of completions dropped sharply in 2021 but recovered in 2022. 


				The second chart compares new unit completions of a range of unit types among multi-family units. While units in buildings with 2 to 4 units, 5 to 9 units, and 10 to 19 units, have declined to a low supply over the years, units in buildings with 20 or more units have sharply increased since 2011, from the trough of around 14,000 units to the peak of 87,000 units in 2019. The completion of housing units in 20 or unit-buildings declined sharply in 2021 to 68,000 units and recovered to 82,000 units in 2022.

			<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle"><br></br><br></br><h2>In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a rapid shift in social, economic, and demographic aspects across the United States, prompting a reconsideration of housing and living conditions broadly in the society. Our research, based on data from the United States Census Bureau and New York City Health and Planning authorities, reveals a substantial impact on the housing market. Nationally, we observe a correlation between population changes and new home developments, with a significant migration trend away from coastal metropolitan areas towards inland and southern states. The suburban and exurban areas experienced faster growth compared to urban centers. Notably, the South, particularly in states like Florida, witnessed a surge in both population and housing supply. </h2></div>

       <div class="page_narrow">
            <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle"><br></br><br></br><h2>Analyzing new housing construction, we note that the Southeast coastal region and certain Mountain states showed the most significant increases. The supply of single-family units experienced fluctuations, while multi-family units, especially in buildings with 20 or more units, showed a notable increase. The study in NYC data revealed homogeneous patterns until the pandemic outbreak with extreme migration volumes observed in Manhattan and Brooklyn neighborhoods in 2020. Although with less correlation, a notable number moved from Manhattan to the Brooklyn and Queens neighborhoods may indicate that the suburbanization also happened in NYC. 
				In essence, our findings underscore the dynamic impact of the pandemic on housing patterns, with shifting preferences, migration trends, and varying construction dynamics reshaping the real estate landscape across the United States.
